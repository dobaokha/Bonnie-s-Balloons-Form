# Bonnie's Balloons Form using C# and VSCode
*ISM 3232 Assignment 3*

The scenario: Bonnie’s Balloons is a small privately-owned balloon shop operated by Bonnie Leiter, who employees a small staff of assistants, including delivery personnel. The shop specializes in high-quality Mylar balloons decorated for special occasions. The price of a balloon order depends on the size of the balloon bundle, what types of “extras” are included with the order (e.g., flowers, candy, etc.), whether a message card is included, and whether the customer picks up the order at the shop or has it delivered to them. Balloon orders are predominantly taken by phone, although there are some walk-in customers. Bonnie is interested in converting the current paper-based order-taking system into an automated one. She has hired you to begin work on this project.
